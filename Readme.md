## Introduction

A rolling deployment is a software release strategy where instances of the old version of an application are gradually replaced with instances of the new version. This approach ensures continuous availability with no downtime.

## Purpose
The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on implementing rolling deployments. It covers the process, best practices, tools, and real-world examples to help you execute smooth and efficient rolling deployments.


## Features

| Feature               | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zero Downtime**     | Gradually replace instances to avoid downtime.                        |
| **Incremental Updates** | Deploy updates in small batches to minimize risk.                     |
| **Automated Rollback**    | Automatically reverts to the previous stable version if issues are detected during deployment. |
| **Automated Deployment** | Use automation tools to streamline the deployment process.            |
| **Health-Driven Updates** | Updates only proceed if the updated instance passes all defined health and readiness checks. |


## Rolling Deployment Process

- ### Preparation

| Step                 | Description                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Environment Setup** | Ensure all servers and environments are configured properly.         |
| **Backup**           | Create backups of the current application state.                     |
| **Testing**          | Thoroughly test the new version in a staging environment.            |
| **Plan Rollout**     | Define the sequence and timing of the deployment across servers.     |


- ### Deployment
| Step                 | Description                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Batch Deployment** | Deploy the new version to a subset of servers at a time.             |
| **Health Checks**    | Perform health checks on updated servers to ensure stability.        |
| **Monitoring**       | Continuously monitor the deployment process for any issues.          |
| **Completion**       | Continue the process until all servers are running the new version.  |

## Rolling Deployment workflow

##  Steps By Step processs

#### 1. Prepare the New Version
- Build and verify the new application version.
- Ensure it is compatible with the existing environment to support smooth transitions.

#### 2. Configure the Load Balancer
- Use a load balancer to manage and route traffic.
- During deployment, it will temporarily remove servers being updated and restore them once verified.

#### 3. Begin Rolling Deployment
- Update servers one at a time (or in small batches).
- After each update, reroute traffic back to the updated server.

#### 4. Run Health Checks
- Validate that each updated server is healthy and functioning as expected.
- Continue only if the updated instance passes all necessary checks.

#### 5. Monitor in Real-Time
- Track key metrics like latency, error rates, and resource usage.
- If abnormalities are detected, pause or roll back the deployment.

#### 6. Finalize Deployment
- Once all servers are successfully updated and stable, conclude the rollout.
- Perform end-to-end validation and continue monitoring for any post-deployment issues.




## **Best Practices**

| **Practice**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Incremental Updates**   | Deploy updates in small batches to minimize downtime.                          |
| **Load Balancing**        | Use load balancers to redirect traffic away from servers being updated.         |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**       | Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines.          |
| **Health Checks**         | Implement readiness and liveness probes to verify instance health.             |
| **Monitoring & Alerts**   | Use tools like Prometheus or Datadog to monitor deployments and alert on issues.|
| **Canary Deployments**    | Release changes to a small set of users first to catch issues early.           |
| **Rollback Mechanism**    | Ensure you can quickly roll back to a stable version in case of failure.       |
| **Secrets Management**    | Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to secure sensitive data.|
| **Auto-Scaling Support**  | Design rolling deployments to work with auto-scaling groups.                   |


## **Tools and Technologies**
