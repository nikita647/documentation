## Introduction

A rolling deployment is a software release strategy where instances of the old version of an application are gradually replaced with instances of the new version. This approach ensures continuous availability with no downtime.

## Purpose
The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide on implementing rolling deployments. It covers the process, best practices, tools, and real-world examples to help you execute smooth and efficient rolling deployments.


## Features

| Feature               | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zero Downtime**     | Gradually replace instances to avoid downtime.                        |
| **Incremental Updates** | Deploy updates in small batches to minimize risk.                     |
| **Canary Testing**    | Test new features on a small subset of users before full rollout.     |
| **Rollback Capability** | Automatically detect failures during deployment (via health checks or monitoring) and roll back to the previous version .        |
| **Automated Deployment** | Use automation tools to streamline the deployment process.            |


## Rolling Deployment Process

- ### Preparation

| Step                 | Description                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Environment Setup** | Ensure all servers and environments are configured properly.         |
| **Backup**           | Create backups of the current application state.                     |
| **Testing**          | Thoroughly test the new version in a staging environment.            |
| **Plan Rollout**     | Define the sequence and timing of the deployment across servers.     |


- ### Deployment
| Step                 | Description                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Batch Deployment** | Deploy the new version to a subset of servers at a time.             |
| **Health Checks**    | Perform health checks on updated servers to ensure stability.        |
| **Monitoring**       | Continuously monitor the deployment process for any issues.          |
| **Completion**       | Continue the process until all servers are running the new version.  |

## Rolling Deployment workflow

## Steps

#### 1. Prepare the New Version
- Build and test the new version of the application.
- Ensure backward compatibility between the new and existing versions.

#### 2. Configure Load Balancer
- Set up a load balancer to distribute traffic among servers.
- The load balancer will gradually redirect traffic to the updated servers during the deployment.

#### 3. Start the Deployment
- Update one server at a time to the new version.
- Once a server is updated, enable it to handle production traffic.

#### 4. Perform Health Checks
- Conduct health checks on each server after updating.
- Proceed to the next server only if the current server passes all checks.

#### 5. Monitor Performance
- Monitor application performance metrics during the deployment (e.g., response time, error rate).
- Roll back the deployment if any issues are detected.

#### 6. Complete the Rollout
- Once all servers are updated, consider the deployment complete.
- Perform post-deployment testing and monitoring.
