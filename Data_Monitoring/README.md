## Introduction

This documentation will guide you through the process of designing an effective database monitoring dashboard. We will cover the essential objectives and key metrics that need to be tracked to ensure the health and performance of your database systems. 

## Objectives

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Provide real-time visibility into the performance and health of the database.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance metrics such as query performance, CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O.
3. **Alerting**: Highlight critical issues and anomalies that require immediate attention.

## Key Metrics

1. **Database Health**
   - Uptime
   - Connection status
   - Availability

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Query performance (average response time, slow queries)
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk I/O (read/write operations)

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - Storage usage
   - Cache hit ratio
   - Network traffic

4. **Error Tracking**
   - Error rates
   - Failed transactions
   - Deadlocks

## Tools and Technologies

1. **Monitoring Tools**
   - **Prometheus**: For collecting and querying metrics.
   - **Grafana**: For visualizing and creating interactive dashboards.

2. **Database Monitoring Plugins**
   - **Grafana Plugins**: Redis, PostgreSQL, ScyllaDB, etc.
   - **Prometheus Exporters**: PostgreSQL exporter, etc.

3. **Alerting Tools**
   - **Prometheus Alertmanager**: For managing alerts.
   - **Slack**: For real-time notifications and collaboration.

## Flow Chart



## Best Practices

1. **Simplicity**: Keep the dashboard clean and simple, focusing on the most critical metrics.
2. **Clarity**: Use clear labels, legends, and descriptions for all widgets.
3. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent design and color scheme.
4. **Performance**: Optimize queries and data collection to ensure real-time performance.
5. **Security**: Ensure proper access controls and data security measures are in place.


## Conclusion

A well-designed database monitoring dashboard is crucial for maintaining database efficiency and reliability. By presenting real-time performance data, it enables proactive issue detection, efficient resource management, and continuous optimization. Following this guide will help you build a clear, effective, and secure monitoring solution tailored to your needs.
